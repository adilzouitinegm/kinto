\- Fix the damn keyboard. -

Memory muscle matters for programmers and developers. (For linux)

This project is only about one thing, remapping the control key to be next to your space bar no matter what keyboard you swap into your workflow and to do it without mastering xmodmap, setxkbmap or modifying system files. 

That also includes making sure that while using your terminal applications the control key maps itself back to the actual ctrl key to avoid terminal generated (tty) signals from misbehaving. You can also retain the ability to copy and paste normally without conflicting with the actual Ctrl+C sigint, which also happens to be the same behavior you'd experience on a mac or space-cadet keyboard, for you lisp fans. 

Note: You will need to edit your terminal preferences and update the shortcuts you want to use, adding "Super+<key>" instead of "Ctrl+Shift+<key>".

## What does this do exactly?

Remaps your keyboard to behave more like you're on a mac again and below is how the keymap will behave.

- Normal apps - Alt will be Ctrl, Win/Super will be Alt, Ctrl will be Win/Super

- Terminal apps (optional) - Alt will be Win/Super, Win/Super will be Alt, Ctrl will be Ctrl

- ~~Modify existing Terminal app keymap profiles (optional and with confirmation) - Copy, Paste, New Tab, etc will be remapped to use Win/Super in the physical Command (or Alt key) position.~~

## How to install

## Troubleshooting
If your keyboard is not being autodetected and configured then please run `xinput list`, if you are on linux, and copy the output into a ticket under issues.
