\- Fix the damn keyboard. -

Memory muscle matters for programmers and developers.

This project is only about one thing, remapping the control key to be next to your space bar no matter what keyboard you swap into your workflow and to do it without mastering xmodmap, setxkbmap or modifying system files. The intent is to make your keyboard work and feel like you're using macOS shortcuts, so you can seamlessly transition between operating systems.

That also includes making sure that while using your terminal applications the control key maps itself back to the actual ctrl key to avoid terminal generated (tty) signals from misbehaving. You can also retain the ability to copy and paste normally without conflicting with the actual Ctrl+C sigint, which also happens to be the same behavior you'd experience on a mac or space-cadet keyboard, for you lisp fans. 

Note: You will need to edit your terminal preferences and update the shortcuts you want to use, adding "Super+<key>" instead of "Ctrl+Shift+<key>".

## What does this do exactly?

Remaps your keyboard to behave more like you're on a mac again and below is how the keymap will behave.

- Normal apps - Alt will be Ctrl, Win/Super will be Alt, Ctrl will be Win/Super

- Terminal apps (optional) - Alt will be Win/Super, Win/Super will be Alt, Ctrl will be Ctrl

- New Features - Cursor/word-wise shortcut keys have been added to align with macOS keyboard shortcuts.

- ~~Modify existing Terminal app keymap profiles (optional and with confirmation) - Copy, Paste, New Tab, etc will be remapped to use Win/Super in the physical Command (or Alt key) position.~~

## Troubleshooting
If your keyboard is not being autodetected and configured then please run `xinput list`, if you are on linux, and copy the output into a ticket under issues.

## Known Issues

### USB Hubs

USB hubs may prevent Apple branded keyboards from loading properly or other Apple specific keyboards that are intended to make use of the "hid_apple" driver. Without this driver it is not possible to run the following command and have it swap alt and cmd.

```
echo '1' | sudo tee -a /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/swap_opt_cmd
```

This is required so that Apple and Windows keyboards can co-exist with the exact same keymappings, provided by setxkbmap. The solution for now is to avoid using a usb hub for your keyboard. Other possible solutions may be finding a way to patch the hid_apple module to accept other vendor and product id's so that it will still load the driver properly.

Other solutions may involve implementing a separate Mac system option in Kinto with a keyswap specific to a usb hub situation, however it will not be possible to have a Windows keyboard (aka internal laptop keyboard) working with the same keymap at the same time.
