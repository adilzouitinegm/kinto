\- Fix the damn keyboard. -

Memory muscle matters for programmers and developers.

If it happens on your mac keyboard then it should happen the same in linux.

## What does this do exactly?

Remaps your keyboard to behave more like you're on a mac again and below is how the keymap will behave.

- Normal apps - Alt will be Ctrl, Win/Super will be Alt, Ctrl will be Win/Super

- Terminal apps (optional) - Alt will be Win/Super, Win/Super will be Alt, Ctrl will be Ctrl

- New Features - Cursor/word-wise shortcut keys have been added to align with macOS keyboard shortcuts.

- ~~Modify existing Terminal app keymap profiles (optional and with confirmation) - Copy, Paste, New Tab, etc will be remapped to use Win/Super in the physical Command (or Alt key) position.~~

## How to install

1. clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/rbreaves/kinto.git
```
2. Install python3 (If needed)

Debian or Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```

3. Follow the prompts and the script will guide you through the rest of the setup.
```
./install.py
```

## Troubleshooting
If your keyboard is not being autodetected and configured then please run `xinput list`, if you are on linux, and copy the output into a ticket under issues.

## Known Issues

### USB Hubs

USB hubs may prevent Apple branded keyboards from loading properly or other Apple specific keyboards that are intended to make use of the "hid_apple" driver. Without this driver it is not possible to run the following command and have it swap alt and cmd.

```
echo '1' | sudo tee -a /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/swap_opt_cmd
```

This is required so that Apple and Windows keyboards can co-exist with the exact same keymappings, provided by setxkbmap. The solution for now is to avoid using a usb hub for your keyboard. Other possible solutions may be finding a way to patch the hid_apple module to accept other vendor and product id's so that it will still load the driver properly.

Other solutions may involve implementing a separate Mac system option in Kinto with a keyswap specific to a usb hub situation, however it will not be possible to have a Windows keyboard (aka internal laptop keyboard) working with the same keymap at the same time.
