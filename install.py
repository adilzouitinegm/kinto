# Print out/confirm the keyboard type or types detected, Windows, Mac, or Chromebook.
# Print out the keymap method/arrangement that will be used for the keyboard(s)
# - Normal apps - Alt will be Ctrl, Win/Super will be Alt, Ctrl will be Win/Super
# - Terminal apps (optional) - Alt will be Win/Super, Win/Super will be Alt, Ctrl will be Ctrl
#
# If Chromebook then create a local symbols file for swapping ctrl and alt.
# - setxkbmap -print > ~/.xkb/keymap/kbd.gui
# - modify ~/.xkb/keymap/kbd.gui xkb_symbols line with +myswap(swap_lalt_lctrl) inside the quotes at the end
# - create/copy lalt_lctrl to ~/.xkb/symbols/myswap
#
# Ask user how they would like their keymap to work
# 2 options will be given 
# 1) Mac like option - Normal swap, but swap alt with super when the terminal is in use, so ctrl key behaves normally.
# 2) Always swapped - Always keep alt as ctrl.
#
# Begin test run on Internal Keyboard, have user confirm that it is correct
# Begin test run on External Keyboard, if one was attached, again ask user for confirmation
# Note: The test may use xev to confirm the key input.
# Ask user if they would like to apply Kinto persistently, run as a service
#
# - Windows keyboards
#   - gui - setxkbmap -option altwin:ctrl_alt_win
#   - terminal -  setxkbmap -option altwin:swap_alt_win
# - Mac keyboards
#  - gui - setxkbmap -option ctrl:swap_lwin_lctl
#  - terminal - setxkbmap -option
# - Chromebook keyboard
#  - gui - xkbcomp -w0 -I$HOME/.xkb ~/.xkb/keymap/kbd.gui $DISPLAY
#  - terminal - setxkbmap -option altwin:swap_lalt_lwin
#
# Ask User if they would like Kinto to hook into udev/usb/hid to create persistent remaps for any keyboard
# If yes then create a file to hook into any udev/usb/hid keyboard devices when plugged in.

# Add autohotkey scripts to handle keymapping for Windows
